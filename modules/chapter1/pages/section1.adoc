- *Demonstrate value and measure ROI*: Easily track key metrics like time savings, job success, and return on investment (ROI). You'll have the data you need to prove the value of your automation investment and share successes with key stakeholders.
- *Make smarter, data-driven decisions*: Get real-time, actionable insights into your automation usage and impact. The dashboard helps you guide IT operations and make smarter decisions based on real data.
- *Optimize and right-size your automation*: Achieve full visibility into your entire automation deployment, including both direct and indirect nodes. This allows you to address over- and under-utilization, ensuring you're getting the most out of your investment.
- *Securely report and share your data*: The on-premise, self-contained utility protects your data while providing flexible reporting options. You can schedule reports and easily ingest the data into your own business intelligence (BI) tools.

== Implementation Details:

- *Deployed securely, on-premise*: The dashboard is a self-contained, on-premise utility that runs on a dedicated RHEL 9 x86 and ARM host, ensuring your data remains secure within your environment.

- *Easy integration*: It integrates with your existing AAP 2.4 or 2.5 instances using an OAuth2 token for read-only access, allowing you to pull data without complex setup.

- *Streamlined installation*: The setup process is a containerized, playbook-driven installation, simplifying deployment and configuration on your RHEL host.

- *Automated data sync*: Once configured, the dashboard automatically syncs and visualizes data from your AAP instances, giving you real-time insights with minimal ongoing effort.

- *Flexible reporting*: The dashboard allows you to generate customizable PDF reports for stakeholders and export raw data to a CSV for ingestion into your preferred BI tools, providing flexible options for demonstrating value.
